## [1.4.0] - 2015-01-08
### Changed
- specify the possible values for `case.contact.callNature`

I am not marking this as a breaking change, in the belief that our
data is already compliant to the new schema

## [1.3.2] - 2015-01-05
### Changed
- removed the `call` model, now merged with the `case` model, which
  represented the same type of documents. technically a breaking
  change, but the `call` model is not used anywhere
- `contact` is now mandatory in a case. all known components are
  already writing it

  a breaking change but that software is not in production yet
